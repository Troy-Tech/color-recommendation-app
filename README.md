# color-recommendation-app

Our clean, minimalist user interface is aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate. No login is necessary. The user will input their eye color, hair color, and skin tone. The app will then return three colors that will match the user’s unique complexion. For example, if the user inputs that they have brown eyes, brown hair, and fair skin tone, the app will output “Based on your eye color (brown), hair color (brown), and skin tone (fair), here are the clothing colors that will compliment your features: Neutral beige, white, and navy blue”.
